<p>I'm a self-taught designer, developer and entrepreneur living in Southern California. I started making graphics and developing websites when I was 9 on a site called <a href="http://neopets.com">Neopets</a>. In my senior year of college, I started <a href="#urtu">NiuPiao/Urtu</a>.

		Urtu is Mongolia's first mobile C2C marketplace and on-demand delivery service, incubated through <a href="leverinc.org">Lever, Inc.</a> I led a team of 6 (including 4 engineers) and drove development to completion on 4 beta products for iOS and web in three months. I also led the design & business side and contributed significantly to frontend and iOS development. Urtu is currently in a closed-beta phase and will launch in late Fall.

We also won Grand Prize of $15,000 at the <a href="http://williamsrecord.com/2015/03/11/niupuiao-wins-business-plan-challenge/">Williams Business Plan Challenge</a> and were finalists at the <a href="http://www.thesmithsophian.com/savvy-business-wins-big-at-annual-draper-competition/">Draper Business Plan Competition</a>, where I <strong>pitched to Tim Draper</strong> and other investors.
